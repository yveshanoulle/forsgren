# Pins .github/workflows/auto_update.yml (forsgren#58, ladder steps 17 to
# 19), the REUSABLE workflow an installation's caller, forsgren-update.yml,
# calls on a Dependabot pull request: it asks `forsgren check-update`
# whether the pull request may be merged, merges it, and starts the
# installation's forsgren.yml. Nothing in forsgren itself runs it, so this
# pin is what proves it, in sfl and Quality, on every run.
#
# Grown one behaviour per cycle, each its own red then green:
#   17a  the file exists and triggers on workflow_call and on nothing else
#        (forsgren's own repository never runs it, no pull request can);
#   (the later cycles are listed in forsgren#58 and add their pins here.)
#
# Read with awk, not a YAML parser, as Scripts/test_metrics_workflow.sh is,
# for its reason: PyYAML is a module, not a command, and nothing here
# installs it.
#
# Usage: Scripts/test_auto_update_workflow.sh
